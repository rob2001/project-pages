  bio: I'm a fourth-year CS undergrad at the Georgia Institute of Technology, working on a BS in Computer Science and a Minor in Mathematics, on course for graduation May 2018. I'm planning on pursuing a Master's in Computer Science starting Fall 2018. A lot of my research interests are in Probalistic Intelligence and in Type Theory. During my free time I'm either learning Italian, working on a cool new project or trying to enjoy my last year as an undergrad.
