# Now

### Last Updated June 23rd, 2018

I am currently in the middle of a 12 week internship at Amazon Web Services,
and working out of their East Palo Alto campus.

When I'm not at work I am working on building a C Compiler (posts coming soon!),
or enjoying my brief time in the SF Bay Area.

In September I will be leaving for Milan to begin a 2 year Master's Program
at Politecnico di Milano.

### About
I originally got the idea for this page from [Derek Sivers](https://sivers.org)
